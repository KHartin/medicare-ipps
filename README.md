This repository contains an example data analysis project using the [Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2011](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3) dataset.

There are two versions of the RMarkdown script: one uses the SQLShare service and the other downloads data from [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov). The purpose of this project is to compare the two data access methods with a simple example.
