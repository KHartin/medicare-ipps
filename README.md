# medicare-ipps

This repository contains an example data analysis project using the [Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2011](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3) dataset.

There are two versions of the RMarkdown script: [one uses the SQLShare service](https://github.com/brianhigh/medicare-ipps/blob/master/medicare-ipps.md) and [the other downloads data](https://github.com/brianhigh/medicare-ipps/blob/master/medicare-ipps-download.md) from [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov). The purpose of this project is to compare the two data access methods with a simple [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) example. 

Each version of the script produces a plot comparable to [one which can be generated](https://github.com/brianhigh/medicare-ipps/blob/master/data-cms-gov-wa-city-inpatient-extracranial-average-covered-charges-medicare.png) with the visualization tools available on the [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov/) website.
